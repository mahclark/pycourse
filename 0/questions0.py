# For each question, I've written some setup code. Don't modify the setup code.
# Write your work underneath where it says "your work:" and of course add new lines if you need.
# The setup code usually contains variables.
# These varibles have example values; you should write the code as if you know the type, but don't know the exact values.

# ============== Question 0 ==============
print("Question 0:")

# Print all of the primitive types in Python that you know.

# your work:



# ============== Question 1 ==============

x = 5

# Print "x is five" only if x is 5.
# Otherwise print nothing.

# your work:

print("\nQuestion 2:")
guitars = 3

# Print "Let's rock!" only if guitars is more than 4.
# Otherwise if guitars is more than 2, print "I need a few more guitars".

# The number of presents you'll receive from your family is given by the variable family_presents.
