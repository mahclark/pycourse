# ============== Question 2 ==============

# For loops iterate over iterables.
# In the function below, write two for loops, each using a different type of iterable.
# Each for loop should print the numbers 1 to 10 inclusive.

# ============== Question 4 ==============

# Using the function multiple_less_than which you completed above,
# complete the function below so it returns a list of lists.
# The list should contain x-1 elements.
# The 1st element should be a list of all multiples of 1 less than x.
# The 2nd element should be a list of all multiples of 2 less than x.
# The nth element should be a list of all multiple sof n less than x.

# E.g.
# if x = 5, we should return:
# [[1,2,3,4], [2,4], [3], [4]]

# ============== Question 7 ==============
print("Question 7:")

# Complete the function below so it returns a list of ints.
# Add together all the elements of each list into a new list and return it.
# I.e. the nth element should equal the nth element of list_A plus the nth element of list_B.
# If the lists are not the same size,
# the remaining items of the longer list should be ignored.
